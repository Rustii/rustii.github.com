rustii.github.com < copy this and add it in cydia
=================

My First Try at a repo

to copy this repo just replace the debs in the debs folder get terminal to the repo folder and then run the update script and then sync with github â€¦.
could not be easier
Oh and a new lesson from todays GPG error REPO.Addy nodata 1 nodata 2 ... DO NOT EDIT THE READ ME ON THE GITHUB WEBSITE... EDIT IT ON YOUR COMPUTER...
For the love of it dont edit it....

*About Update information*
if you want to know what changes i to the debs check the commit logs, i always comment what has changed in them.
or check the changes in the source files
